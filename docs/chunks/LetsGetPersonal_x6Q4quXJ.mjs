We develop <mark class=\"bg-blue-200\"> a design space of 47 personalized visualizations</mark> - or popular media visualizations that allow news readers to segment data by attributes such as race, gender, and income. Through this design space, we identify (un)common design mechanisms that may impact users' exploration and understanding of topics such as health, politics, and finance.
