We pay special attention to how these features impact women, given existing systemic gender oppression across the gobe. Based on this work, <mark class=\"bg-blue-200\">we make recommendations for developing actors and platforms</mark> - including advocating for intersectional well-being frameworks, standardizing features, removing reliance on algorithmic management, and minimizing hierarchies between workers and users.\n";
