          I am a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at Stanford University, where
          I am co-advised by James Landay and Michael Bernstein. Prior to
          Stanford, I completed my Master's at the UIUC, where I was co-advised
          by Karrie Karahalios.

          Within my work, I research tools and methods to actualize equitable
          design. In my Master's, I designed and evaluated computer science
          ethics activities to better train future developers. Now, as a Ph.D.
          candidate, I am developing lightweight and robust design methods to
          elicit different communities' perspectives within design feedback. In
          particular, I often use social computing platforms as case studies for
          improving equitable experiences across systems.
