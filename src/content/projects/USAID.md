How does the algorithmic management behind online and ride-share gig work impact women working in developing countries? We synthesize literature from academia, government agencies, NGOs, and public media to 1) compile **common platform and algorithmic features** of gig work platforms, and 2) highlight how these features **can impact worker well-being** across developing contexts. We pay special attention to **how these features impact women**, given existing systemic oppression. Based on this work, we make **recommendations for developing actors and platforms** - including advocating for intersectional well-being frameworks, standardizing features, removing reliance on algorithmic management, and minimizing hierarchies between workers and users.
