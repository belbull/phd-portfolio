🧠 How can we support the **inclusion of ethics** in existing computer science courses?

👩🏾‍🔬 We present a **novel reposirory of computer science (CS) ethics modules** to aid the inclusion of ethics within existing CS courses. To show its potential value, we highlight a **pilot of our predicitve policing module** that aimed to provide an 'ethical laboratory' for undergraduate students in an intermediate algorithms course.

📊 Our findings show that students were **able to contextualize ethical issues**, but wanted **more class time** devoted to the activity.
