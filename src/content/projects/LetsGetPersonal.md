Through this design space, we **identify (un)common design mechanisms** that may impact users' exploration and understanding of important topics related to health, elections, and finance.

📊 We find that visualizations often lack explicit exploration suggestions or instructions, data notices, and personalized visual insights. We also outline **three trajectories for future research**.
