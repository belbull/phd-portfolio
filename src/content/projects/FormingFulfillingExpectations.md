🧠 How do computer science Ph.D. students **form and fulfill expectations** in their programs?

👩🏾‍🔬 Prior work has shown that understanding program and department expectations plays a key role in doctoral degree completion. In order to better support doctoral students in meeting these expectations, we **interview 14 CS Ph.D. students** from underrepresented groups on how they identify and meet expectations in their programs.

📊 We offer two recommendations for departments - **lab-based mentorship and goal clarity** - to better support students.
