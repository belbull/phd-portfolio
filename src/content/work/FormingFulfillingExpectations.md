Prior work has shown that understanding program and department expectations play a key role in doctoral degree completion. <mark class="bg-blue-200">So, how do computer science Ph.D. students form and fulfill expectations in their programs?</mark> To answer this, <mark class="bg-blue-200">we interview 14 CS Ph.D. students</mark> from underrepresented groups on how they identify and meet expectations in their programs. We offer two recommendations for departments - <mark class="bg-blue-200">lab-based mentorship and goal clarity</mark> - to better support students.
