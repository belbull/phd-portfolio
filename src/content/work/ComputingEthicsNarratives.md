<mark class="bg-blue-200"> How can we support the inclusion of ethics in existing computer science courses?</mark> We present <mark class="bg-blue-200"> a novel reposirory of CS ethics modules </mark> that can be embedded within existing CS courses. To show this, <mark class="bg-blue-200"> we pilot our predicitve policing module</mark> that aims to provide an 'ethical laboratory' for undergraduate students in an intermediate algorithms course. Our findings show that <mark class="bg-blue-200"> students were able to contextualize ethical issues</mark>, but wanted more class time devoted to the activity.
