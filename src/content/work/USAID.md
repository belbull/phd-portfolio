<mark class="bg-blue-200"> How does the algorithmic management behind online and ride-share gig work impact women working in developing countries?</mark> We synthesize literature from academia, government agencies, NGOs, and public media to 1) <mark class="bg-blue-200">compile common platform and algorithmic features</mark> of gig work platforms, and 2) <mark class="bg-blue-200">highlight how these features can impact worker well-being</mark> across developing contexts. We pay special attention to how these features impact women, given existing systemic gender oppression across the gobe. Based on this work, <mark class="bg-blue-200">we make recommendations for developing actors and platforms</mark> - including advocating for intersectional well-being frameworks, standardizing features, removing reliance on algorithmic management, and minimizing hierarchies between workers and users.
