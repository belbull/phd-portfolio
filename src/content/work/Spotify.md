<mark class="bg-blue-200"> How do we evaluate the impact of methods for equitable recommendations</mark>, particularly those that aim to support racial equity? Synthesizing prior literature, <mark class="bg-blue-200"> we outline different methods for evaluating recommendation interventions</mark> aimed at improving equity, as well as their challenges and interaction with privacy regulations like GDPR. We extend this analysis through <mark class="bg-blue-200"> the case study of editorial interventions </mark> within the context of online music recommendations.
