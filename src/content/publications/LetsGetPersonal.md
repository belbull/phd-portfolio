focus: "By exploring how designers structure personalized visualizations - or popular media visualizations that allow news readers to segment data by attributes such as race, gender, and income - we identify under-utilized design mechanisms that may impact users' ability to explore and understand visualizations. Given that these visualizations provide readers with important insights on topics ranging from elections to public health, we use our findings to highlight design needs and research directions for more equitable and user-centered, personalized visualizations."
